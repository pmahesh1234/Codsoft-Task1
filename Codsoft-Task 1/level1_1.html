            <p>Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world.<br> Basic functions such as playing music are totally free, but you can also choose to upgrade to Spotify Premium.</p>
            <p>Spotify offers digital copyright restricted recorded audio content, including more than 100 million songs and six million podcast titles, from record labels and media companies.As a freemium service, basic features are free with advertisements and limited control, while additional features, such as offline listening and commercial-free listening, are offered via paid subscriptions.

Whether you choose a free or paid account, you can enjoy music and podcasts on a variety of devices, such as smartphones, computers, and smart speakers.

                Spotify uses intelligent algorithms to study what you listen to and then suggests playlists and new music that you might like. If you go for a Premium account, you get extra perks like no ads, better sound quality, and the option to download songs to listen to them offline. Spotify is built to make finding and enjoying music easy, making it a key part of how we listen to music today.</p>
                <p>Smart Shuffle on Spotify is an innovative feature made to improve how we listen to music by intelligently mixing up the songs in a playlist. This creates a varied and interesting sequence of songs.

This feature is designed to pleasantly surprise users by mixing familiar songs, new finds, and hidden gems in a way that feels customized.</p>
